List of things to keep track on:

* Create dashboard for each implemented metricset
* send also document if remote system is not reachable -> error document
  * What happens on error of fetch?
* disable _all for all fields
* disable _source? for all fields
* Filters on metricset level
  * Idea: Minimum, Basic, Full data to have predefined sets / levels
  * Or is this done via filter implementation
* Add fields per module / metricsets
* Add templates
