== Frequently Asked Questions

This section contains frequently asked questions about Packetbeat. Also check out the
https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats/packetbeat[Packetbeat discussion forum].

[[client-server-fields-empty]]
=== Why are the client_server and server fields empty?

The `client_server` and `server` fields are empty when Packetbeat is not configured
to capture information about the network topology.

To capture information about the network topology, set the `save_topology` configuration option to true and make sure that
you are sending the output to Elasticsearch.

[[dashboard-fields-incorrect]]
=== Why is the dashboard in Kibana breaking up my data fields incorrectly?

The index template might not be loaded correctly. See <<packetbeat-template>>.

[[packetbeat-mirror-ports]]
=== Why doesnâ€™t Packetbeat see any packets when using mirror ports?

The interface needs to be set to promiscuous mode. Run the following command:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ip link set <device_name> promisc on
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For example: `ip link set enp5s0f1 promisc on`

[[packetbeat-missing-transactions]]
=== Why is Packetbeat missing long running transactions?

Packetbeat has an internal timeout that it uses to time out transactions and TCP connections
when no packets have been seen for a long time. 

To process long running transactions, you can specify a larger value for the <<transaction-timeout-option,`transaction_timeout`>>
option. However, keep in mind that very large timeout values can increase memory usage if messages are lost or transaction
response messages are not sent.
