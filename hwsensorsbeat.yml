################### Hwsensorsbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Hwsensorsbeat ######################################

hwsensorsbeat:
  # Defines how often an event is sent to the output
  period: 2s

  # Devices to fetch below hw.sensors. By default everything is retrieved, however
  # you can limit this to only `hw.sensors.cpu0` by specifying `cpu0` here.
  #devices:
  #  - cpu0
  #  - acpithinkpad0

output:
  elasticsearch:
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
#    #index: "beatname"

    # A template is used to set the mapping in Elasticsearch
    # By default template loading is disabled and no template is loaded.
    # These settings can be adjusted to load your own template or overwrite existing ones
    #template:

      # Template name. By default the template name is beatname.
      #name: "beatname"

      # Path to template file
      #path: "beatname.template.json"

      # Overwrite existing template
      #overwrite: false

  ### Console output
  #console:
  #  pretty: true

logging:

  # Send all logging output to syslog. On Windows default is false, otherwise
  # default is true.
  #to_syslog: true

  # Write all logging output to files. Beats automatically rotate files if rotateeverybytes
  # limit is reached.
  #to_files: false

  # To enable logging to files, to_files option has to be set to true
  files:
    # The directory where the log files will written to.
    #path: /var/log/mybeat

    # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
    #name: mybeat

    # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
    # automatically rotated
    rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

    # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
    #keepfiles: 7

  # Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
  # Other available selectors are beat, publish, service
  # Multiple selectors can be chained.
  #selectors: [ ]

  # Sets log level. The default log level is error.
  # Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
  #level: error
