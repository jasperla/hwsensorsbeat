hwsensorsbeat:
  # Defines how often an event is sent to the output
  period: 1s

  # MIBs to fetch below hw.sensors. By default everything is retrieved, however
  # you can limit this to only `hw.sensors.cpu0` by specifying `cpu0` here.
  # Currently only third level MIBs are checked (i.e. `cpu0` but not `cpu0.temp`),
  # however it should eventually be possible to use expressions such as `*.temp`
  mibs:
    - cpu0
    - acpithinkpad0
